To launch the application the host needs JRE and slick2D installed. If running the application on mac JRE 1.6 or lower is needed. 
The Jar-file can be launched by writing java -jar SmurfTD.jar in the terminal. 
We found out about the runnable jar-file a bit late so we hope this works, we had problems with the slick library.


All meeting agendas can be found on the wiki for the repository on GitHub.
RAD and SDD are in the folder PDF.
